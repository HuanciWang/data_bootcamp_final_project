    "    The way to produce a successful movie is always a hot issue worldwide. If a movie is successful, people are always eager to figure out the reason why the movie succeeds, which may help the movie companies and studios to produce the next successful movies. This project will study the factors of making a successful movie. We will focus on two aspects: rating and gross revenue, which means that the movie has good feedback and high box-office. In the first part, we will discuss how the directors, actors, budget, and genres will influence the rating of the movies. And we will find out the factors that help movies receiving high-ratings. In the second part, we will first discuss the budget, which is a base of gross revenue. Then, we will figure out the factors of the high-grossing movies. Finally, we will explore the relationship between gross revenue and PPP, gross revenue and ROI."
